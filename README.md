# Vladislav // System Architect in Training

> Fusing a passion for linguistics, worldbuilding, and low-level systems to build high-performance creative tools.

## Mission: Operation Genesis Engine

I am building a suite of standalone, high-performance desktop tools for creators. This project is a public "proof of work" and a journey in mastering the craft of software engineering.

*   **Current Project:** [genesis-engine-lexicon](https://github.com/[Mirged]/genesis-engine-lexicon) - A procedural language generator.
*   **The Forge (Language):** `Rust`
*   **The Philosophy:** To build durable, offline-first software that respects the user and their creative process.

### Core Principles

1.  **Performance First:** Creative flow shouldn't be interrupted by a loading bar. All tools are native and built for speed.
2.  **User Sovereignty:** No subscriptions, no cloud dependencies. When you acquire a tool, you own it. It works forever.
3.  **Transparent Development:** The entire creation process is public. Follow along as I learn, build, and solve problems in the open.

### Current Focus

*   Mastering the fundamentals of Rust (ownership, borrowing, structs).
*   Implementing core phonetic and grammar rule systems for Lexicon.
*   Documenting every step of the journey.
